Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.
Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood through adulthood.
Therapy and counseling can help people manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and more.
