Valorant Tips:
- Communicate with your team using voice or quick chat.
- Practice your aim daily using aim trainers or deathmatch.
- Use your agent's abilities wisely — they’re tools, not crutches.
- Learn callouts for maps like Bind, Ascent, and Haven.
- Walk instead of running to stay silent and avoid detection.
